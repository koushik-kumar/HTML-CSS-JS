<!-- HTML Local Storage 
    Introduction: Since the HTTP transport layer is stateless, the data gets reset everytime we close and open. And for
    this, data used to be stored previously using cookies, where it stores to a maximum of 4KB, sent with every request
    leading to the load on server. Hence, for this overhead, HTML5 came up with HTML Local storage. These store data in 
    the form of key-value  pairs and is available through two versions, Session Storage and Local Storage.
    -Session Storage data is available for that complete session( till the window is closed and then get deleted). The 
    session storage is not available to multiple windows even from same domain unlike Local Storage.
    -Local Storage is available to all the windows of same origin(Domain). The Local Storage data is available even after
    the browser is closed.
